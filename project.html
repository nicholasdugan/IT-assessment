                <h2>Project: Chatterbot</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The project I wish to complete will be a chatterbot, the aim will be to achieve the highest possible level of complexity with this project while ensuring a successful end product that can operate without any issues. The overall goal will be to start small and add further complexity as I progress.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>When working in a shared office space last year when I started my business, I met a man who had built and designed a chatterbot which allowed people to enter in available food that they had for cooking and the chatterbot would find a recipe that you could make and would also help guide you through the process of cooking the meal and help wherever you had problems. This was something that I found really interesting and expanded my understanding of what is possible with a chatterbot and hence I see this as the perfect opportunity to increase my skills in order to possibly implement this product into my own business. </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>An industry that I have a large understand of is the ski industry therefore the goal here will be to combine the two to make a chatterbot that is relevant to the ski industry. What I aim to create is a chatterbot where one can input a particular item of ski/snowboard gear such as a pair of skis or a pair of boots. The chatterbot will then be able to take that specific model and compare it with other items of the market that will best be able to match the requirements and the specific characteristics that the original item has. Hopefully this chatterbot will be able to recommend items across both brand and price options and provide a recommendation that best benefits the user rather than relying of a store clerk who is recommended to sell higher priced gear or may be unable to best recommend the item that would suit the customers’ requirements. </p>
                <p>As I have a relatively low understanding of IT and especially coding, I aim to make this as simple as possible while still maintaining the overall functionality. Any extra additions can be added upon once the basic foundations are solid enough to allow it as I wish to avoid any large issues. </p>
                <p>The process for users will be:</p>
                <p>Initial Input: Here the user will input the name of the item that they have.</p>
                <p>Category Request: Here the user will indicate what item category they wish to see such as bindings, boots or both.</p>
                <p>Item Recommendation: Here the chatterbot will provide recommendations for which items will best suit the product.</p>
                <p>(Possible) Product location: Here the chatterbot if approved will recommend the location where they can purchase</p>
                <p>Request for new item: This process will be to close the loop and allow for the chatterbot to continue to be used.</p>

                <h3>Tools and Skills</h3>
                <p>This assignment will require extra work on the side to improve my skills in order to reach a level where I can achieve my goals. This will be done though full participation in all parts of the syllabus to ensure that I am accessing all available information that could help as well as looking to outside sources to aid me wherever I may find difficulty. My capabilities may be lacking in some areas therefore it is up to me to ensure I find adequate guidance to help me in these areas whether it’s from my teachers or other students.</p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The outcome I aim to reach is to meet all components of the process listed above while still maintaining functionality. Any extra levels of performance above that are beneficial and are something to aim for however my main goal is functionality for the requirements that I have set.</p>
